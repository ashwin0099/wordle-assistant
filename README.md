this solver helps us to guess the word which is either right or if wrong then the answer reveals the most information
so that our next guess can be correct
for ease i have attached both jupyter note book and direct python code
both code are same you can use any one



to run program correctly you also have do download words_len5.txt file and store it in the same folder as you python program
